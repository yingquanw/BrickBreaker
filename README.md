This is a small java game where user controls the paddle to bounce off the ball 
to hit the bricks. Once all the bricks has been hit, the player wins
the game. But be careful, if you didn't catch the ball, and it touches 
the bottom, you lose the game. There is a timer on top so that you can 
compete with yourself or your friends.

##Instructions:
1. Press SPACE to start the game <br>
2. Press LEFT and RIGHT to move the paddle<br>
